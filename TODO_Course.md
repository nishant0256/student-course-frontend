# TODO: Add Search Bar to Course.jsx

- [ ] Add new state `searchQuery` using useState to hold the search input value.
- [ ] Add a search input field in the UI, placed above the ul, with placeholder "Search courses by title".
- [ ] Create a `filteredCourses` variable that filters courses by title (starts with, case-insensitive) and sorts them alphabetically A to Z using `localeCompare`.
- [ ] Update the ul to map over `filteredCourses` instead of `courses`.
- [ ] Run the development server to test the search functionality.
- [ ] Verify that typing in the search bar filters and sorts the list correctly.
