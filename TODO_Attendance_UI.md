# TODO: Update Attendance.jsx UI to Match Student.jsx

## Steps to Complete
- [ ] Add header section with title "Attendance Management" and "Mark Attendance" button
- [ ] Add search input for filtering records by student name
- [ ] Add status filter dropdown (All, PRESENT, ABSENT, LATE, EXCUSED)
- [ ] Restructure attendance records display into a table with columns: ID, Student, Course, Status, Date
- [ ] Move marking attendance form into a modal, opened by the "Mark Attendance" button
- [ ] Apply modern styling: rounded-xl, shadows, blue headers, hover effects, icons from lucide-react
- [ ] Ensure all backend functions (fetchStudents, fetchCourses, loadAttendance, submit) remain unchanged
- [ ] Test UI responsiveness and functionality
